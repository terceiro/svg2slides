= INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

$ sudo ruby setup.rb

= DEPENDENCIES

Running svg2slides depends only on Ruby's standard library, so if you have Ruby
installed you should be good.

For installation, though, you'll need the rdtool package
(http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/rdtool/), which is used to generate
svg2slide's manpage. On a Debian system (or derivatives) you can install it
with:

  apt-get install rdtool

= GET STARTED

Type `man svg2slides` on your terminal and read the fine manual.
