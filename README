= SYNOPSIS

svg2slides - generates slides from layered SVG drawings

svg2slides reads SVG drawings that have layers and produces as output one SVG
per layer. The output SVG file for each layer has that layer and all the
layers below it, i.e. the layers above the current layer are removed from the
drawing. This is useful to generate sequences of slides, where slide N is
composed of layers 1, 2, ..., N of the original drawing.

   expanded with the index of the slide and inserted between the basename of
   the input file and the .svg extension to form the output file names.

   Examples (assuming "file.svg" as the input file):

   | Suffix | Output file names |
   | -%03d  | file-001.svg, file-002.svg |
   | _%d    | file_1.svg, file_2.svg |
